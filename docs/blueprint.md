## Style Guidelines:
- Use a clear, sans-serif font optimized for readability on screen. Choose a font with good character spacing and a variety of weights to create hierarchy.
- Utilize a consistent set of icons, focused on simplicity. Icons should support the text labels and provide visual cues for key actions and concepts.
- Implement a block-based design for content sections, making sure to follow a clear visual hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle animations when flipping cards or updating stats to provide visual feedback and engagement.
